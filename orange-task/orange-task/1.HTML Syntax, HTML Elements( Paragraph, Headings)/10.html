    <h2><u>what is  the introducation of math</u></h2>
    <p>Mathematics <mark>is one of the most important subjects</mark>. Mathematics is a subject of numbers, shapes, data, measurements and also logical activities. It has a huge scope in every field of our life, such as medicine, engineering, finance, natural science, economics, etc. We are all surrounded by a <b>mathematical world</b>.

        <u>The concepts</u>, <mark>theories and formulas that we learn in Maths books have huge applications in real-life</mark>. To find the solutions for various problems we need to learn the formulas and concepts. Therefore, it is important to learn this subject to understand its various applications and significance.</p>

        <h3>introduction in chemistry</h3>
        <p>

           <mark>chemistry</mark> , the science that deals with the properties, <u>composition, and structure of substances (defined as elements and compounds), the transformations they undergo, and the energy that is released </u>
            or absorbed during these processes.
            <b> Every substance,</b> whether naturally occurring or artificially produced, <mark><u>consists of one or more of the hundred-odd species </u></mark>
             of atoms that have been identified as elements. Although these atoms, 
             in turn, are composed of more elementary particles, they are the basic building blocks of chemical substances; there is no quantity of
              oxygen,<del>mercury, or gold, for example, smaller than an atom of that substance. Chemistry, therefore, is concerned not with the subatomic domain but with the properties of atoms and the laws governing their </del> combinations and how the knowledge of these properties
               can be used to achieve specific purposes.
